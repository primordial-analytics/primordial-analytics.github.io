                        <p>As with many other websites, our Website may use “cookies” or other technologies to help
                            us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your reservations or requests,
                            and/or to analyze your visiting patterns. We may collect the following types of
                            information about your visit including: the domain from which you access the Internet;
                            IP address; operating system and information about the device or browser used when
                            visiting the Website; date and time of your visit; content you visited; and website
                            (such as google.com or bing.com) and website referral source (email notice or social
                            media site) that connected you to the Website. Our Website uses two types of cookies:
                            single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Temporary cookies last only
                            as long as your web browser is open, and are used for technical purposes such as
                            enabling better navigation through our Website. Once you close your browser, the cookie
                            disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods and are
                            used for purposes including tracking the number of unique visitors to our Website and
                            information such as the number of views a page gets, how much time a user spends on a
                            page, and other pertinent web statistics. Cookies, by themselves, will not be used by
                            Primordial Analytics to disclose your individual identity. This information identifies your
                            browser,
                            but not you, to our servers when you use the Website. We do not respond to “do not
                            track” signals in your browser. We may also collect data by using “pixel tags,” “web
                            beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “pixel tags”) that allow us to
                            know when you visit our Website. Through pixel tags, we obtain non-personal information
                            or aggregate information that can be used to enhance your online experience and
                            understand traffic patterns.</p>

                            providers, and search information providers).</p>
                        <p>In addition, we may use third-party providers to serve or track interactions on other
