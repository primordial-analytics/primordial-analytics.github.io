**Client's Problem:** _"We have a strategic growth initiative (SGI) aimed
at transforming the company from being simply data-driven to being
analytics-driven. However, we do not have the leadership experience
and personnel (we think) internally to extend our reporting unit into
an advanced analytics (AA) group. The large consulting firms we use
for most other projects are trying to sell us the Moon and stars, with
a price tag that fits. To make things more complex, we would like some
in-flight projects to evolve with the AA SGI and include machine
learning ideas our existing team has proposed."_

What an awesome problem to have! A funded advanced analytics
effort. We loved this engagement: it involved equal parts projects,
process, and people. At a high-level, the Client's reporting unit
needed a strategic road map that aligned them with the advanced
analytics initiative. We helped craft that road map and put it into
action.

The first step was learning and enunciating the Client's vision and
mission in terms of analytics. This involved interviewing the C-level
executive team and various department heads with vested interests in
analytics. Further interviews with the people in the reporting unit
yielded a list of core values that they expected in themselves, their
mission, and their leaders.

A thorough self-audit was then conducted (effort-value of existing
projects, a group S.W.O.T., a company P.E.S.T., readiness, competitive
advantages, etc.).  With these inputs in-hand, they were synthesized into
strategic focuses for the new AA group. Alongside the leaders of the
reporting unit, we crafted near- and long-term objectives for the new
group to pursue. Each near-term objective was additionally sliced into
a series of goals with defined metrics/KPI's and estimated time
lines.

A major part of the road map was people and their development. The
short-term solution was embedding Primordial teams to do project work
while also assisting in the hiring of experienced people to lead the
new AA group. Another major hurdle was the deployment of new
technologies and development tools (e.g. AWS, Docker, GitHub, Airflow,
Presto) to create efficiencies for the new group. The Primordial teams
owned the roll-out of, and training on, these systems for seamless
handover.
