### Happy 7th Anniversary

Today, we proudly celebrate Primordial Analytics' seventh anniversary! If 2024-25 taught us anything, it's that change is the only constant in healthcare policy.

#### Navigating the Policy Rapids

This past year has felt like whitewater rafting through a policy storm. The Trump administration's return brought sweeping changes to CMS, including a 5.1% increase in Medicare Advantage payments (the largest in a decade) and a renewed focus on healthcare price transparency through executive orders. For a company built on making sense of healthcare data, it's been like watching someone constantly rearrange the furniture while we're trying to navigate the room. But here's the thing about data scientists: we love a good puzzle, especially when the pieces keep changing shapes.

#### Our Response: Doubling Down on Community Impact

While policy winds have been swirling, we've stayed true to our north star: using data science to improve community healthcare outcomes. This year, our volunteer initiatives have become more crucial than ever. When CMS announced that some models would be ending early, creating savings of almost $750 million but leaving participants to transition to other models, we saw an opportunity.

- **Policy Translation Projects**: We've helped 12 non-profit healthcare organizations navigate the changing regulatory landscape, translating complex CMS updates into actionable insights
- **Community Health Dashboards**: Launched eight new volunteer-built dashboards for community health centers, helping them track and improve patient outcomes despite shifting federal priorities
- **Transparency Tools**: With renewed focus on healthcare price transparency, we've developed open-source tools helping smaller healthcare providers comply with reporting requirements
- **Medicare Advantage Analytics**: As payment structures evolved, we provided pro-bono analysis, helping community organizations understand the implications for their patient populations

#### The Silver Lining in Policy Chaos

Healthcare data doesn't care about politics. A diabetic patient needs the same quality care whether Medicare Advantage payments go up or down. A community health center needs the same insights to serve its population effectively, regardless of which administration is setting policy.

This year reinforced why our volunteer model matters. While the Trump administration issued a flurry of executive orders and policy directives targeting HHS and healthcare-related agencies, community healthcare organizations needed steady, reliable support more than ever. That's where Primordial Analytics shines. Political winds do not sway us because our mission is fundamentally about people, not policy.

#### Looking Ahead: Year Eight and Beyond

As we enter our eighth year, we're more energized than ever. The healthcare landscape may be shifting, but the need for thoughtful, community-focused data science has never been more precise. We're planning to expand our volunteer network, launch new partnerships with rural health centers, and continue building tools that help healthcare providers focus on what matters most: patient care.

None of this would be possible without our incredible network of volunteer data scientists, community partners, and the healthcare heroes who trust us with their most important data. You've made these seven years not just successful, but meaningful.
