### Hello, World!

Primordial Analytics Consulting LLC was officially incorporated today and is beginning client work. Before we were a business, those clients knew us as individuals. They thus were willing to take a chance on a small group of dedicated analytical professionals with a clear vision and mission. For everyone else, we're just another (hopefully) friendly website and a bunch of consulting jargon. So we thought our first blog post should be about us: a virtual handshake or business card of sorts (we have those too if you prefer).

### Why do we exist?

The number of companies that have monetized analytics in all its forms (reporting, prescriptive, predictive, optimization) is growing. Analytics success stories tend to be highly visible because many of them are incredible – "Okay Google, build me a rocket ship." By extension, this puts pressure on every business and its leadership to deliver more, and more comes from getting analytical. But that's easier said than done.

When a leader tackles an entirely new discipline or tangential to their current expertise, it's stressful and risky. Analytics is still immature, and companies face a dilemma of whom to leverage:

1. Experienced leadership that may lack technical knowledge
2. Professional technical experts that may lack leadership experience

The classic sucker's choice: either/or. We recommend the "and" solution: this is where **PRIMORDIAL** comes in!

There is an urgent market need for technical experts with strong leadership skills, strategic vision, and a keen eye for business value. Our team is specifically composed of people that have acquired all those skills. As a result, we're here to help companies in their journey. Our goals are not to do only one of work, strategy, and technical leadership – we aim to provide all of those simultaneously.

### Who are we?

We're data scientists, engineers, and AI experts – we have to be able to do the work-work. We are also a team of people who have experience taking completely unstructured business problems and converting them into concrete deliverables. To that end, we favor automation and simplification. You can get a taste of some deliverables in the **[CASE STUDIES](/#portfolio)** on the main page.

What makes us unique is that we're good at working with a business' subject matter experts to define their problem and developing a shared vision. Analytics isn't just about understanding the problem that needs to be solved; it's about understanding **WHY** the issue needs to be solved. Our process focuses on the "why." We share the key points of our techniques in the **[PROCESS BREAKDOWN](/process)**.

Our hallmarks are energy and passion. We are not a boring lot that will tune out, lose interest, or give a half-effort. We love problem-solving, building things, and working with others. That enthusiasm comes with us to every project, every client site, and is in all our team members. Being self-motivated and inspired gives rise to high-quality work because we care. You can find more info in the **[PEOPLE DISCUSSION](/people)**.

### Why the name?

Primordial: existing at or from the beginning of time; basic and fundamental. We want to be there from the start, keeping it basic and fundamental. From the simplest building blocks come the more complex elements over time. We strive to facilitate and take part in that process for your business. Our focus is not the complex end; it's the simple beginning. "Crawl, walk, run" is a famous development mantra. We prefer "atoms, gas clouds, galaxies." That's the reason our imagery and branding are celestially themed.
