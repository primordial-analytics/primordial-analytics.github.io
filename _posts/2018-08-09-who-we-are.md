### Hello, World!

Primordial Analytics Consulting LLC was officially incorporated today and is beginning client work. Before we were a business, those clients knew us as individuals, and thus were willing to take a chance on a small group of dedicated analytical professionals with a clear vision and mission. For everyone else, we’re just another (hopefully) nice website and a bunch of consulting jargon. So we thought our first blog post should be about us: a virtual handshake or business card of sorts (we have those too if you prefer).

### Why do we exist?

The number of companies that have monetized analytics in all its forms (reporting, diagnostics, predictive, etc.) is growing. Analytics success stories tend to be highly visible because many of them are cool – “Okay Google, build me a rocket ship.” By extension, this puts pressure on every business and its leadership to deliver more, and more comes from getting analytical. But that’s easier said than done.

When a leader is placed in the position of tackling a completely new discipline, or one that is tangential to their current expertise, it’s stressful and risky. Being that the analytics field is relatively young, companies encounter a dilemma: leverage experienced leadership that may lack the technical expertise necessary, or take a chance on experienced technical people that may lack the leadership experience. This is the classic sucker’s choice (either/or), and we suggest the “and” solution: get both. But that’s easier said than done.

This is where **PRIMORDIAL** comes in! There is an urgent market need for technical experts with strong leadership skills, strategic vision, and a keen eye for business value. Our team is specifically composed of people that have acquired all those skills. As a result, we’re here to help companies in their journey. Our goals are not to just do the work, or just build strategy, or just provide technical leadership – we aim to provide all of those simultaneously. And when our work is done, the company, its leaders, and its people have benefited from the experience and don’t need us anymore.

### Who are we?

Obviously, we’re data scientists, engineers, and AI experts – we have to be able to do the work-work. We are also a team of people that have experience in taking completely unstructured business problems and converting them into concrete deliverables. To that end, we favor automation and simplification. You can get a taste of some deliverables in the **[CASE STUDIES](/#portfolio)** on the main page.

What makes us unique is that we’re really good at working with a business’ subject matter experts to define their problem and developing a shared vision. Analytics isn’t just about understanding the problem that needs to be solved, it’s about understanding **WHY** the problem needs to be solved. Our process is aimed specifically at this point: why do we want to do this work and what do we want to do? We share the key points of our techniques in the **[PROCESS BREAKDOWN](/process)**.

Our hallmarks are energy and passion. We are not a boring lot that will tune out, lose interest, or give a half-effort. We love problem-solving, building things, and working with others. That enthusiasm comes with us to every project, every client site, and is in all our team members. Being self-motivated and inspired gives rise to high-quality work because we care. You can find more info in the **[PEOPLE DISCUSSION](/people)**.

### Why the name?

Primordial: existing at or from the beginning of time; basic and fundamental. We want to be there from the beginning, keeping it basic and fundamental. From the simplest building blocks come the more complex elements over time, and we strive to facilitate and take part in that process for your business. Our focus is not the complex end, it’s the simple beginning. “Crawl, walk, run” is a popular development mantra. We prefer “atoms, gas clouds, galaxies.” That’s the reason our imagery and branding is celestially themed.
