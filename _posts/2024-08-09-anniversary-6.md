### Happy 6th Anniversary

Today, we proudly celebrate Primordial Analytics' sixth anniversary! As we pivot to focus on **VOLUNTEER** data science initiatives for non-profit community healthcare organizations, we want to reassure our legacy clients that they remain a vital part of our journey. We will continue to serve them, albeit on a smaller scale, as we embark on this new direction.

This new direction not only allows us to leverage our AI and data analytics skills but also opens up new opportunities for growth and impact. By partnering with organizations that share our commitment to improving healthcare outcomes for underserved communities, we are expanding our reach and contributing to a more equitable healthcare system. Here's to a future where data science serves the greater good!
