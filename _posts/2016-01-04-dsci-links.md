Life-long learning demands a plan.

Below is a living, ordered compendium of online courses related to
data science. This list was inspired by the [Open Source Data                                             Science](http://datasciencemasters.org/) repo on GitHub. I have completed all but a couple in the
last five years and can vouch that the content met **MY**
expectations **AT THAT TIME.** These courses change, die, or get
new instructors, I can't vouch for your experience. However, there is
so much other content out there for free that if one of these links
doesn't meet your needs, search for another -- you'll find it. Drop a comment if
you find an improvement.

Comments: The list is repetitive and low-level in parts. I like the
analogy "science is a language," hence repetition of the fundamentals
reinforces fluency. This list reflects that thinking. It's also
ordered in such away that the topics build on each other. I wish I'd
had these topics in this order when I originally found them all.
